 * 
 * Network Design:
 * Is not replicated directly. Invaders are added by the LockOnTargetComponent which is replicated.
 * The LockOnTargetComponent finds the Target locally and then notifies the server which Target and Socket are captured.
 * This means that the HelperComponent's state shouldn't be changed on the server, instead a client RPC or replicated systems callbacks should be used.
 * For example, don't set the bCanBeCaptured to false on the server when the Target becomes 'dead'.
 * Mark it with a something like 'health system's (which is probably replicated) OnDead event that is called on all clients.
